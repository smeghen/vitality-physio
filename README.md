## Vitality Physio
The idea for this project is all based around a fictional Physiotherapy practice called "Vitality Phyios", with the site showcasing the range of services and treatments that they offer. Users will have the ability to pre-purchase and pay for these services online, with registered users being able to avail of a discount and access to blogs posted by Physiotherapist on a range of topics. The site will also provide a contact page to submit any queries that users may have.

 The live website can be found here: https://

## Structure:


Below is a Site diagram that I used as a basis for the structure of the project:

![Site Structure](media/Site-Diagram.png "Site Structure Diagram")

#### Database Schema:

Below is the database schema that I devised for the project:

![Database Schema]( "Database Schema")



## Design:

#### Colour scheme: 
The colour scheme for the site consists of red, white and light grey. The red will be used for the Vitality Physio logo and will carry the branding throughout the site. The overall theme of the site will be clean and clinical to reflect the nature of the business, so the colours will be subtle and minimal. This was also chosen so that the colours are not overwelming and distracting to the users of the site. 



#### Imagery:

 


#### Wireframes:

Here are the wireframes that I used as the basis of the design
for the site. These were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com//).

##### Home Page

# Testing

The testing process can be found [here](TESTING.md)

# Issues Encountered

* When working on products.html in the products app I had difficulty getting the product images to display. After checking numerous options and searching for spelling mistakes, the answer was found on Slack. I was missing the 'django.template.context_processors.media', in the TEMPLATE 'context_processors' in settings.py.

* When trying to link to AWS I encountered an issue that Heroku would fail in building and deploying giving an error log of ModuleNotFound: No module named 'storages'. I reviewed the steps that I had taken and checked my installs using the command pip list, which showed that django-storages had been installed. In settings.py it had been added correctly to the Installed Apps and I review the requiremnents.txt and it was showing. After many hours of searching the error on Slack and stepping through the process I could not find anything that was done wrong. After leaving the issue overnight and looking at it freah the next day I ran through the same checklist and discovered that on restarting the workspace the requirements.txt was missing items that had previously been showing. Doing a pip3 freeze > requirements.txt and pushing the changes and all worked fine and Heroku was able to connect to AWS.


# Deployment

##  GitHub Project Creation
To create the project the following steps were used:

* In GitHub repositories section click the green 'New' button 
* Select the Code Institute template
* Name the repository and give a brief description
* Set repository to 'Public' to ensure the commit history is visible
* Click 'Create repository'
* Once created the workspace is built in Gitpod by clicking the Gitpod button.


## Deploy to Heroku
The website was deployed as follows:

* Navigate to Heroku.com and login.
* Click on the new button.
* Select create new app.
* Enter the app name.
* Select region.

Set up connection to Github Repository:

* Click the deploy tab and select GitHub - Connect to GitHub.
* A prompt to find a github repository to connect to will then be displayed.
* Enter the repository name for the project and click search.
* Once the repo has been found, click the connect button.

Set environment variables:

Click the settings tab and then click the Reveal Config Vars button and add the following:
* key: IP, value: 0.0.0.0
* key: PORT, value: 5000
* key: MONGO_DBNAME, value: (database name you want to connect to)
* key: MONGO_URI, value: (mongo uri - This can be found in MongoDB by going to clusters > connect > connect to your application and substituting the password and dbname that you set up in the link).
* key: SECRET_KEY, value: (This is a custom secret key set up for configuration to keep client-side sessions secure).

Enable automatic deployment:

* Click the Deploy tab
* In the Automatic deploys section, choose the branch you want to deploy from then click Enable Automation Deploys.


## Run Locally

To run the code locally:

* Navigate to the repository
* Click the 'Code' drop down menu
* Select to copy the GitHub URL from HTTPS box or 'Download Zip'
* Open a new terminal and type 'git clone' command in the CLI and paste copied URL
* Alternatively, click 'Open with GitHub Desktop' and follow the steps to complete the clone

Once the project has been loaded, run the command 
> pip install -r requirements.txt 

  to install all the required packages.

The project will not run locally with database connections unless the user sets up an env.py file configuring 
IP, PORT, MONGO_URI, MONGO_DBNAME and SECRET_KEY. You must have the connection details in order to do this. 
These details are private and not disclosed in this repository for security purposes.

### Code



* The Boutique Ado walk through project by Code Institute was used as an excellent starting point for this project. Much of the structure of the project was based around this and was adapted, 
modified and expanded to suit the functionality of the porject.

* Code for scrolling content of bootstrap card found on Stackoverflow and modified to meet my needs: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49818715/scrollable-card-bootstrap
