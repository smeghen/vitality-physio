## Manual Testing


The following browsers were used to test the website â€“ Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari.

For the testing of this project I devised a spreadsheet detailing the tests to be performed for the various pages and features.
Below is an image of a small section of this spreadsheet:

![Testing spreadsheet sample](media/TESTING-Images/manual-testing.JPG "Sample of Testing Spreadsheet")

The full version of the spreadsheet can be downloaded [here.](https://github.com/smeghen/vitality-physio/media/TESTING-Images/MS4_Testing.xlsx)

Please note this is a .xlsx file and will require excel, google docs or compatiable program to open the file.
The testing was performed on PC, Tablet and Mobile devices and all tests passed. I have shown in the spreadsheet the tests
that caused issues and have included notes in relation to these.

## User Testing

Family members, peers of Slack and friends were asked to test the website and provide their thoughts on the user 
experience and any bugs that they found. Within this group of people the site was viewed on the following devices
 â€“ Desktop, Laptop, iPad mini, iPad, iPhone 6, iPhone 8, Samsung Galaxy S6 and Huawei P30.

* Some feedback that I received was in relation to the Checkout page and the layout of the address form. Originally I had put it in without any particular thought to the sequence of the fields. I have since rearrange the fields so that they are logically in relation to a postal address.

* It was spotted that I had $, Â£ and â‚¬ symbols in various places for price throughout the site, this was easily rectified by locating the symbols and updating the all to â‚¬.

* On smaller screens it was found that the text on the Home page About section was overflowing and being lost, this was fixed by adding padding to the container so that the text would always be pushed away from the edges of the container.

## Issues Encountered 

* When working on products.html in the products app I had difficulty getting the product images to display. After checking numerous options and searching for spelling mistakes, the answer was found on Slack. I was missing the 'django.template.context_processors.media', in the TEMPLATE 'context_processors' in settings.py.

* When trying to link to AWS I encountered an issue that Heroku would fail in building and deploying giving an error log of ModuleNotFound: No module named 'storages'. I reviewed the steps that I had taken and checked my installs using the command pip list, which showed that django-storages had been installed. In settings.py it had been added correctly to the Installed Apps and I reviewed the requiremnents.txt and it was showing. After many hours of searching the error on Slack and stepping through the process I could not find anything that was done wrong. After leaving the issue overnight and looking at it fresh the next day I ran through the same checklist and discovered that on restarting the workspace the requirements.txt was missing items that had previously been showing. Doing a pip3 freeze > requirements.txt and pushing the changes and all worked fine and Heroku was able to connect to AWS.
